# sleep-control.js  

#### Prevent devices from dimming, locking or turning off the screen when the application needs to keep running  

Mobile devices respect you when you watch a video on a page or app and wait until the video ends before switching to sleep mode.  
But they don't respect you the same way when you watch an image slideshow and they often dim the screen before the slideshow is over, which is annoying.

__sleep-control.js__ solves this problem by playing a tiny little invisible video to extend the sleep timeout and lets your users watch the contents of your app without the UX being cut in the middle.
