#### Prevent devices from dimming, locking or turning off the screen when the application needs to keep running

Mobile devices respect you when you watch a video on a page or app and prevent switching to sleep mode until the video ends.
But they don't respect you the same way when you watch an image slide show and dim the screen before the slide show ends, which is annoying.

sleep-control.js solves this problem by playing a tiny little invisible video to let your users see everything they need to see without the UX being cut in the middle.
